# 90DaysOfDevOps
- This repository is used to document my journey on getting a better foundational knowledge of "DevOps". 
- I'm starting this journey on 25th Decemeber 2022 and the idea is to take 100 days.
- The reason for documenting the journey is so that others can take something from it and also hopefully enhance the resources.
- Inspired by [Michael Cade's 90DaysOfDevOps](https://github.com/MichaelCade/90DaysOfDevOps)
